## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In the most general terms, the **DigiLabBE** project aims to create a digital platform which will allow students and the general public to learn how to create, use and learn from digital twins. The purpose is therefore to teach the concept of Digital Twins, to teach how to build them and, at the same time, to turn them into Digital or Virtual Laboratories where creativity can be applied to the generation of new content and ways of teaching.
